Pokemon project that I've done with my group member in c++ lecture

Pokémon Master is a C++-based Pokémon game where players explore Pokémon battles, capture mechanics, and type advantages using ASCII art for Pokémon appearances.

🎮 Features:
Pokémon Object System: Each Pokémon has unique properties and strengths (e.g., Water beats Fire).

Monster Ball Mechanics: Capture probability system based on Pokémon strength.

Pokémon Directors: Battle through all Pokémon trainers to unlock the Pokémon Master.

ASCII Art Design: Pokémon visuals are created using ASCII Code for a retro-style experience.

Defeat all trainers, Pokémon master, and catch Pokémon to become the ultimate Pokémon Master! 🚀🔥🎮
