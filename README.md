Become a Pokémon Master!

Pokémon Master is a **C++-based Pokémon game** developed as part of a group project in our C++ lecture. The game simulates **Pokémon battles, capture mechanics, and type advantages**, all while incorporating **ASCII art** for a nostalgic retro-style visual experience.

🎮 Features:

✅ **Pokémon Object System**  

- Each Pokémon is represented as an **object with unique attributes**, such as **HP, attack power, and type advantages** (e.g., **Water beats Fire**).
  
- Players can **level up Pokémon** by winning battles and learning new moves.  

✅ **Monster Ball Capture Mechanics**  
- Pokémon capture success is determined by a **probability system** based on the Pokémon's remaining HP and strength.
  
- Players can use different types of **Poké Balls** with varying catch rates.  

✅ **Trainer Battles & Pokémon Master Challenge**  
- Players **battle a series of Pokémon trainers** to progress through the game.
  
- After defeating all trainers, the **final challenge is to beat the Pokémon Master**.
  
- Strategic battles require players to **utilize type advantages and optimize team composition**.  

✅ **ASCII Art Pokémon Design**  
- All Pokémon **appear as ASCII art**, providing a **retro-inspired visual experience**.
  
- This adds a unique aesthetic and brings a **text-based adventure feel** to the game.  

🏆 **Goal:** **Defeat all trainers, battle the Pokémon Master, and catch Pokémon to become the ultimate Pokémon Master!** 🚀🔥🎮
